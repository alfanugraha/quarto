In the summer of 2021, I taught 36-315: Statistical Graphics & Visualization, offered through the Department of Statistics & Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University. This was a full-credit undergraduate course focused on data visualization in R, using `ggplot2`. The course has its own website, linked above, with all lecture slides.
