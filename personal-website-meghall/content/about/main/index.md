  I am a data manager in higher ed. I contribute to the public sports analytics community by helping beginners learn R as well as by writing and presenting on various aspects of hockey analysis as a member of [Hockey-Graphs](https://hockey-graphs.com/). I was previously a data scientist at [Zelus Analytics](https://zelusanalytics.com/).
  
  I frequently deliver talks and workshops on Râ€”for useR groups, R-Ladies groups, and conferences such as the Carnegie Mellon Sports Analytics Conference and Hockey (Analytics) Night in Canada. In the summer of 2021, I taught [an undergrad course on data visualization](https://meghan.rbind.io/project/cmu/) at Carnegie Mellon University.
