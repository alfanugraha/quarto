title: An Introduction to R With Hockey Data
---

[*From Hockey-Graphs*](https://hockey-graphs.com/)

I have written a couple articles over the past few months on using R with hockey data (see here and here), but both of those articles were focused on intermediate techniques and presumed beginner knowledge of R. In contrast, this article is for the complete beginner. Weâ€™ll go through the steps of downloading and setting up R and then, with the use of a sample hockey data set, learn the very basics of R for exploring and visualizing data.
