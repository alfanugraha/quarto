<p>In March 2020, the Greater Boston useR Group hosted a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Boston-useR/events/269130710/">Virtual Tidy Tuesday Meetup</a>, and I gave a 10-minute lightning talk on getting started with building custom themes in <code>ggplot2</code>. The slides should be embedded below!</p>
