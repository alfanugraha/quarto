title: Exploratory Data Analysis Using Tidyverse
---

[*From Hockey-Graphs*](https://hockey-graphs.com/)

Welcome to the second article in our series on basic data cleaning and data manipulation! In this article, we’re going to use play-by-play data from two NHL games and answer two questions:

- [x] which power play unit generated the best shot rate in each game?
- [x] which defenseman played the most 5v5 minutes in each game?

In the process of doing so, we’ll cover several topics of basic data manipulation in the tidyverse, including using functions, creating joins, grouping and summarizing data, and working with string data.
